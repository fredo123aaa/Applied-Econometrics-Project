# Applied Econometrics Project

This repository contains the final project for the **Applied Econometrics** course.

## Overview

The project applies econometric methods to analyze real-world data using regression models, diagnostic testing, and hypothesis evaluation. The analysis is implemented in Jupyter notebooks and documented in the accompanying PDF report.

## Repository Structure

## Methods & Tools

The project includes:
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing**
- **Descriptive statistics and visualization**
- **Econometric modeling (OLS and extensions)**
- **Hypothesis testing**
- **Model diagnostics** (heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, specification tests)
- **Interpretation of regression outputs**

### Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `statsmodels`
- `scipy`
## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fredo123aaa/Applied-Econometrics-Project.git
   cd Applied-Econometrics-Project
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
   .\venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scipy
   ```

4. Open the notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Project_Fredo.ipynb
   ```

## Results Summary

The notebooks contain:
- Regression results with statistical significance tests.
- Visualizations illustrating relationships between key variables.
- Econometric interpretation of estimated coefficients and diagnostics.

Refer to **`MODS206_AppliedEconometrics.pdf`** for a full written report and discussion of results.
